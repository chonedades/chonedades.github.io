<!--p class="message">
  Put here something interesting...
</p-->

I am currently a Master student in Computer Science in the
[University of Kaiserslautern]. In the field, I have a strong interest for
Machine Learning, with a special focus on Deep Neural Networks, having
experience with the mainstream Machine Learning libraries.

In the course of the last four years, I have also grown interest for the
Cognitive Sciences (initially for Linguistics; later for Psychology and
Philosophy; and currently for Computational Neuroscience, given my focus
on Deep Learning), having worked in the area for a while.

My Curriculum Vitae is available
[here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2-sLZMv4F61VG5OcVlKeDVtQk0).


Finally, I also like to write poems and songs. Check out the tabs in the
side bar for a list of my "artistic production" :-)
