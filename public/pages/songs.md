I sometimes write score sheets. Some are just transcriptions, some are
original compositions.
Through the years, I used several programs: up until some time, I used to
generate .mus files; later I started using Tux Guitar, and finally in
the last months I have migrated into Musescore.

Below I list some of the transcriptions I made, along with the format in which
they are. Unfortunately, I can't open the .mus files anymore, so I can only
hope they still work.


## Transcriptions

Most of the transcriptions I have done were from video-game soundtracks
(something that I listen to a lot). Below are some of the things I wrote:

 *  Water Stage (Super Mario Bros.)

    [tuxguitar](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2-sLZMv4F61VGRUejhFbHc0ems).

## Original Compositions

I am starting to write my own compositions. I hope the simplicity of my
harmony doesn't offend modern professional musicians.


 *  After that day...

    [musescore](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B2-sLZMv4F61NEdfSG5HQ2ZZMzA).
    <br>_(named like this because it somehow reminds me on "The day after", from
    Final Fantasy VI)_
 *  Tense
