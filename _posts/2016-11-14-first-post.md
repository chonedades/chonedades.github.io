Good morning and welcome to the Black Mesa Transit System. This
automated train is provided for the security and convenience of the
Black Mesa Research Facility personnel. The time is 8:47 AM. Current
topside temperature is 93 degrees with an estimated high of 105. The
Black Mesa Compound is maintained at a pleasant 68 degrees at all
times.

Well... this is a greetings delivered by the Black Mesa Transit
System. In the upcoming weeks I intend to have some serious content
in this blog, which will hopefully replace this dummy blog post.

In the meanwhile, maybe you could take a look at the Poems and Songs
sections in the sidebar =)
